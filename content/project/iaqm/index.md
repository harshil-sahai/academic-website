In Delhi, one of the worldâ€™s most polluted cities, there is relatively little information on indoor air pollution and how it varies by socio-economic status (SES). Using Indoor Air Quality Monitors (IAQMs), we find that winter levels of household air pollution exceed W.H.O. standards by more than 20 times, both in high and low SES households. We then evaluate a field experiment that randomly assigned month-long IAQMs user trials across medium and high SES households but suffered from significant survey non-response. Among respondents, IAQMs did not affect take- up of subsidized air purifier rentals or other defensive behavior.
