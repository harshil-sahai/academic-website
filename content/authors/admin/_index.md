I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at The University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu), where I am a [National Academy of Education / Spencer Dissertation Fellow](https://naeducation.org/2022-naed-spencer-dissertation-fellows/) and a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org). I use experiments, data, and economic models to study policy questions in developing countries. My current work includes working with government agencies in India to evaluate the welfare impacts of private school voucher policy; developing field experiments in Delhi to estimate the demand for clean air; and partnering with Facebook to quantify the role of social networks in driving migration within India.
