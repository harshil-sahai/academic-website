I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics at The University of Chicago](https://economics.uchicago.edu), where I am a [2022 National Academy of Education / Spencer Dissertation Fellow](https://naeducation.org/2022-naed-spencer-dissertation-fellows/) and a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org). I use experiments, data, and economic models to study policy questions in developing countries. My current work includes evaluating the welfare impacts of private school voucher policy in India; estimating the demand for clean air in Delhi using field experiments; and quantifying the role of social networks in explaining spatial mobility across India.
