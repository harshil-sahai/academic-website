I use experiments, data, and economic models to study policy questions in developing countries. I'm particularly interested in revealed preference approaches to valuing non-market goods, such as education, air pollution, and social networks. My current work includes evaluating the welfare impacts of private school voucher policy in India; estimating the demand for clean air in Delhi using field experiments; and quantifying the role of social networks in explaining spatial mobility across India.
